    <!-- ESP-HTML: you may use as many HTML tags as you like (<span> is recommended).
         To enable ESP-HTML for a tag, it has to be of the class "ESPvalue" and it must have
         a unique ID.
         If this is the case, the HTML code inside this tag will be replaced by a sensor value,
         defined by the attributes
         * ESP = Name of an Element in ESP_JSONData
         * Sensor = Index of the Sensor object inside the JSON data
         * Value = Index of the value inside the Sensor object
         If the optional attribute "unit" is defined, this unit will be added after the value
         (separated by a space character).

   <!-- I used a "." so the tag's html is not entirely empty and I can see some placeholder while loading the page.
       This can be anything and will be replaced by the value. -->
